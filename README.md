HR Benefits AI Agent REST API application

(current project: test_project)

Backend/REST Interface:
Thus far, this project consists of a
barebones, simple REST API, written in Java.

Data is stored in a Mysql DB (data content will
be expanded once AI agent logic is developed).

AI agent logic is written in Python to provide
the app information from LLM sources.

Front end/UI Interface:
Currently only use a simple JavaScript script to query
via the REST API interface.

Ultimately plan to add a ReactJS front end UI for 2 purposes;
(1) to provide an interface to the functionality
provided in the AI agents, and
(2) to give me a means of learning ReactJS.
